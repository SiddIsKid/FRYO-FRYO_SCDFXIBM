            <h4>DURING THE WARNING:</h4><br>

            1. Bring in outdoor possessions (lawn furniture, grills, trash cans) or tie them down securely.<br>
            2. Listen to your local radio or television station for updates.<br>
            3. If evacuation appears necessary, turn off all utilities at the main power switch and close the main gas valve.<br>
            4. Have immunization records handy (or know the year of your last tetanus shot)<br>
            5. Shut off your electricity at the breaker panel<br>
            6. Clear out gutters and drains so that water can flow freely.<br>
            7. Keep important documents in a water proof locker in the house, if available, or carry it with you when evacuating. <br>
            8. Make a family communication plan, if separated. <br>
            9. Keep your GPS on for further information on evacuation routes. <br>
            10. Raise your appliances/ electronic gadgets to a higher level - bed, cupboard etc.<br>
            11. Put a sandbag in the toilet bowls to prevent backflow of sewage. <br>

            <h4>POST FLOODING:</h4><br>

            1. Stay away from flood water - do not attempt to swim, walk or drive through the area<br>
            2. Be aware of areas where water has receded. Roadways may have weakened and could collapse.<br>
            3. Avoid downed power lines and muddy waters where power lines may have fallen.<br>
            4. Throw away any food and bottled water that comes/may have come into contact with floodwater.<br>
            5. Come back home only when officials ask you to do so.<br>

            <h4>WHAT NOT TO DO:</h4><br>

            1. Panic or hyperventilate.<br> 
            2. Drive or use any vehicle through the flooded area.<br>
            3. Walk through running water, 6 inches of running water can knock one off their feet, instead use a stick to measure the depth of the water.<br>
            4. Touch electrical appliances with wet hands.<br>
            5. Carry non-essential objects like clothes, bags etc. while evacuating.<br>
