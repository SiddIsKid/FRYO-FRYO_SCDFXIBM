He has been the Winner of International Science Olympiad by Silverzone holding the 1st International rank and has been a Qualifier for science seminar held by Satyendra Nath Bose National Centre Science for Basic Science. He has also qualified for the Conscious Youth Challenge
By The Conscious Living. The high risks of flood in lower coastal areas that threaten the civilian population reminds him of the uncertainty of life. He believes that we must always be prepared and is therefore, onboard Team FRYO!

#### Mahek:  
Mahek has a strong academic background evidenced by her diverse aptitude in literature and physics. Her involvement in youth leadership programs has led her to gain insights from experienced individuals.

She finds the FRYO solution promising and wishes to support the cause of better disaster management in Singapore.

## Meaning of FRYO:
FRYO is an acronym for Flood Relief Youth Operations which successfully summarizes the team’s aim of providing assistance to people in flood prone areas by modelling a technological solution to tackle the problem of flash floods in Singapore. It also refers to an internal joke among the team mates which corresponds to the answer to the deductive statement: ‘A group of three is considered a trio, then a group of five should be fryo.’ 

## Getting started:
This is a simple web application, so there is no setup required at all. All you have to do is download the code files, go to the public folder and open index.html which will take you to the FRYO webpage. 

To check if you are in the proximity of a potential flood region, all you have to do is click on the button which says 'Click to check flood exposure'. This will tell you if your are in danger of a flood and if you are, the safest route out of that area.

For now, since we do not currently have access to the water level sensors installed by PUB, we currently have fake threat coordinates which are **Latitude: 1.39267** and **Longitude: 103.8221315**. 

To run a test and check if the app actually works, you can change the values of the variables lat and long in the file to something close to the fake coordinates to see how it would respond if there were an actual threat.
